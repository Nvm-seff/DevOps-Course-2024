# DevOps Course 2024: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the DevOps Course 2024! This repository is a comprehensive guide to my learning and contributions in the field of DevOps. Below, you will find a summary of my two key blogs, a sample repository from the internet showcasing DevOps practices, and an application of various DevOps tools and techniques. I've also included insights into my knowledge expansion throughout the course.

## Blogs Summary

### 1. [Setting Up Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Explorer Using Docker and Docker Compose](https://medium.com/@saifullah.rizv/setting-up-hyperledger-fabric-and-hyperledger-explorer-using-docker-and-docker-compose-ef0f079ab688)
In this blog, I walk you through the entire process of setting up a blockchain network using **Hyperledger Fabric**, which is a permissioned blockchain platform designed for enterprise solutions, and **Hyperledger Explorer**, a web-based tool for viewing and interacting with the blockchain network. I leverage **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to streamline the deployment and configuration process, allowing for rapid setup and easy scalability. 

By following this guide, you’ll be able to:
- Deploy Hyperledger Fabric using Docker containers.
- Set up a local instance of Hyperledger Explorer for blockchain data visualization.
- Understand the basic principles of permissioned blockchain networks and how to interact with them.

#### Key Learnings:
- Practical steps for deploying Hyperledger Fabric and Explorer in a Dockerized environment.
- How to interact with blockchain networks using Explorer.
- The significance of Docker Compose for simplifying multi-container applications.

### 2. [Infrastructure as Code (IaC): The Backbone of Modern DevOps](https://medium.com/@saifullah.rizv/infrastructure-as-code-iac-the-backbone-of-modern-devops-0bed7d019608)
In this blog post, I explore **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, which is a key component in modern DevOps practices. IaC allows teams to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files, which in turn promotes consistency, reduces human error, and speeds up deployment cycles. I delve into the most popular IaC tools, including **Terraform** and **Ansible**, and discuss their integration into DevOps workflows to enable automated infrastructure management and deployment.

By reading this blog, you’ll gain insights into:
- The core principles of IaC and its impact on DevOps practices.
- How to use IaC tools like Terraform and Ansible to automate infrastructure provisioning.
- The benefits of IaC in improving system reliability, scaling infrastructure, and achieving faster development cycles.

#### Key Learnings:
- The importance of IaC in modern DevOps pipelines.
- How IaC tools like Terraform and Ansible help in automating infrastructure deployment.
- Understanding the link between IaC and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## DevOps Tooling and Sample Repository

### Sample Repository:
For this section, I’ve chosen a sample repository that demonstrates the application of essential DevOps tools and practices in a real-world context. This repository highlights the integration of CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure provisioning using tools such as Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

[Sample Repository: DevOps Tooling Demonstration](https://github.com/sample-repo-url)

The repository includes:
- A fully configured CI/CD pipeline.
- Docker containerization for application consistency across environments.
- Kubernetes deployment for managing containerized applications at scale.
- Infrastructure management through Terraform scripts for reproducible environments.

### Applying DevOps Tooling:
In this section, I apply the knowledge I’ve gained to enhance and automate the development lifecycle. I've worked on implementing **Jenkins** for CI/CD, **Docker** for containerization, **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, and **Terraform** for infrastructure automation. These tools help automate repetitive tasks, manage deployments efficiently, and ensure smoother collaboration across development teams.

#### Tools Used:
- **Jenkins**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments for application development and deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates Docker containers, allowing scalable and manageable deployments.
- **Terraform**: Manages infrastructure as code to automate cloud resource provisioning.

## Expanding My Knowledge

Throughout this course, I have significantly expanded my knowledge of DevOps practices by diving deep into the following areas:
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: With Jenkins, I’ve learned to build robust and efficient CI/CD pipelines that automate testing and deployment.
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Through Docker and Kubernetes, I have gained hands-on experience in containerizing applications and managing them at scale in production environments.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Using Terraform, I’ve automated the creation and management of cloud infrastructure, ensuring faster, more reliable provisioning.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: I’ve learned the importance of continuous monitoring in DevOps to identify performance issues, improve system reliability, and iterate rapidly based on feedback.
